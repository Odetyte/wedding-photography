    <h5>Capturing <br>Memories</h5>
      <p> Ageing is a funny thing. One's perspective of life changes. Time is passing by and sometimes
   you think, oh I wish I had that picture. In my opinion a photograph is like a time
    capsule. It brings you memories. It can bring you those warm feelings  you know what I
    mean, what you looked like, what thoughts were going through your mind, where you were
    in life and what mattered the most.
